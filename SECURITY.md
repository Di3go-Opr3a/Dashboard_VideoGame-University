## Reporting security issues.

If you find a security problem or vulnerability in the project, we encourage you to report it immediately to the responsible developers. You can do so by sending an email to [developers' email address] with all relevant details. Please do not open a public issue on GitHub for security problems, as it may put your data security at risk.

## Response to security issues.

The project developers are committed to responding to all security issues in a timely manner. We will do our best to address and resolve security issues as quickly as possible. Please provide as much information as necessary to enable us to understand and reproduce the problem, including steps to reproduce it and details on the context in which it occurs.

## Security updates.

If vulnerabilities or security issues are identified in the project, the developers will try to provide security fixes or updates as soon as possible. However, we cannot guarantee exact timing for the release of such fixes. Please keep your copy of the project up-to-date using the latest versions available.

## Developer Involvement.

If you have questions or concerns about project security, or if you would like to report a security issue privately, you can contact the developers at [developer email address]. We will do our best to answer your questions and resolve security issues as best we can.
